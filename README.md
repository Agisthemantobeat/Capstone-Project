We load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithms on the data. We are expected to use the following algorithms to build your models:

    ## k-Nearest Neighbour
    ## Decision Tree
    ## Support Vector Machine
    ## Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

    ## Jaccard index
    ## F1-score
    ## LogLoass
